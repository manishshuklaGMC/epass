# Purpose
Epass(Anumati) is an open source software, which was developed to help various government authorities authorize 
individuals for specific activities during covid restrictions.
It supports requesting for individual passes or bulk passes for 
corporates. The passes can be digitally verified by enforcement authorities.


We thank Egov foundation for taking ahead this project to production by deploying, 
maintaining and further developing over it.
